# chat

my website start with welcome page then when you click get started it goes to login page by default ,there is an email you should put is "user@example.com" and password is "password123" ,then a toast will show that you logged in successfully ,you can switch to sign up page put it doesn't have api ,and the whole fields are validated by yup and I used formik for forms ,when you log in the navigation will take you to chat page which has a chat bot the translate your text into any language you detect from the options in the navbar there is something else work in this page which is them ,on the left there is a moon or sun icon based on the mood you want to switch ,and arrow icon to close and open the side bar

I used routes ,tailwind ,react-toastify and many others to adjust a responsive and well functionality website
you only need to run npm i ,then use the email and password I told before and everything is clean
